This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.



```{julia}
## this should be how to activate our project specific packages (just need to figure our work dir)
# using Pkg; Pkg.activate(pwd())
```


::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::


::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a tip with a caption.
:::



::: {.callout-warning}
## Warning With Caption

This is an example of a warning with a caption.
:::


::: {.callout-important}
## Important With Caption

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
This would allow us to have foldable code. 


```{julia}
#| echo: true
 1 + 1 
```
